# The Simpsons Birthday Card

The creation of the Simpsons Birthday Card project revolves around fetching a random quote from a character in The Simpsons and presenting it in the style of a birthday card.

For this initiative, Axios is utilized to make the API request, fetching JSON data from the [Simpsons API](https://thesimpsonsquoteapi.glitch.me/). A specifically designed function is implemented to execute the API call, leveraging the Async/Await syntax to effectively manage asynchronous operations.
